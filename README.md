# Township-SMME-Hackathon-2022

The hackathon is slated to bring together skilled data experts, data engineers, data scientists, Microsoft front- and back-end developers and business analysts from across Africa.

Participants will be tasked with the challenge of solving the pervasive problem of unlocking economic growth in townships in South Africa using the opportunities available through the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).

The specific problem that the hackathon seeks to solve is how tech solutions can solve township small, medium-sized and microenterprisesâ€™ (SMMEsâ€™) business information and data challenges to improve their business efficiencies.

This issue was conceptualised in a dedicated township SMME workshop facilitated by the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation and managed by the SAtion Ecosystem team.

The workshop drew together SMMEs and entrepreneurs from Tembisa, Gauteng, to understand how the business information and data both held and not held by their enterprises can be better used to open up more SMME business growth opportunities.

According to Statistics South Africaâ€™s latest reports, over 46% of South Africans are unemployed on the expanded definition â€“ that is, one that includes people who are available for work, but not looking for a job.
